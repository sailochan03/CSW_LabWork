    <h1>About myself:</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Sai Lochan Dash. I was born in Bhubaneswar but I spent my childhood in Bhanjanagar. My family
        moved to Berhampur in 2014 and there I spent my teenage years. I passed my 10<sup>th</sup>std from KV Berhampur
        and 12<sup>th</sup>std from SSVM Neelakantha Nagar. Without any doubt those were the best years of my life. Now
        I am studying in Institute of Technical Education and Research(ITER), SOA University in Bhubaneswar. I am
        pursuing my bachelors degree in technology with a focus on Computer Science and Engineering. I will be
        graduating in the year 2026. Let's hope I get there safe and sound. Have a good day!!!</p>
